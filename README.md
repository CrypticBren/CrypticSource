# CrypticSource(you will need .net 8.0)
# Just a quick notice this is not in any way associated with Rec Room/Against Gravity
# And also this is of course a template so don't try and claim that i am responsible for anything you do
 This is A OpenSource Old Rec Room Server Template That is using ASP.NET and because i am too lazy this is only gonna be for the September 29th 2018 build which you will have to get and patch it yourself and this will only have the required things to get into the dorm room the rest you have to figure out or do it yourself
